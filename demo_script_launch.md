# 🎬 Demo Script: Local AI Coding Setup Launch

## **3-Minute Launch Demo**

### **Hook (0-30 seconds)**
```
"What if I told you that you could have better AI coding assistance than ChatGPT for 
less than the cost of a coffee per month, with complete privacy and no subscription fees?"
```

**[Show comparison screen]**  
Left: ChatGPT $20/month subscription  
Right: Local setup $0/month  
**Visual impact**: Subscription pain vs Local AI bliss

---

### **Problem Statement (30-75 seconds)**
```
"Every developer knows the frustration:
- $70/month minimum for AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot $10 + ChatGPT $20 + Claude $20 + others)
- Your code data sent to third parties
- Internet required for every request
- Models you can't customize or optimize
- No control over your AI assistant"
